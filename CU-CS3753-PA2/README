In order to run multi-lookup:
1) "Cd" into the directory where multi-lookup.c is located
2) Run "make"
3) Run multi-lookup by typing "./multi-loop <input_file> results.txt" (where <input_file> is one or multiple of the names.txt files separated by spaces and results.txt is the output file)
4) Check results.txt to see the output of the hostname and the IP address
5) Run "make clean" to clear the entire build

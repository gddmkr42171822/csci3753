./cpu-process - A simple program for statistically calculating pi
./io-process - A simple program for statistically calculating pi using
             a specific scheduling policy
./mixed-process - Runs the code from both
cpu-process and io-process

Scheduling Policy:
SCHED_OTHER
SCHED_RR
SCHED_FIFO

Number of Processes:
